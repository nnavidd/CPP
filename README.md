# C++ Modules (00–09)

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the **C++ Modules 00 to 09**, part of the 42 school curriculum. These exercises are designed to provide a deep understanding of modern C++ (mostly C++98/03 and C++11), covering fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, memory management, operator overloading, inheritance, templates, and exception handling.

Each module builds on the previous one, gradually introducing new features of the language while reinforcing best practices and coding discipline.

## Module Overview

### 🧱 Module 00 — Basics of C++

* Compilation, namespaces, I/O streams (`std::cout`, `std::cin`)
* Basic class structure, member functions
* `const`, `static`, and initialization

### 🧠 Module 01 — Memory & References

* Stack vs Heap
* References and pointers
* Dynamic memory allocation (`new` / `delete`)
* Memory leaks and proper cleanup

### 🔁 Module 02 — Ad-Hoc Polymorphism

* Operator overloading
* Function overloading
* `this` pointer
* Class methods and const correctness

### 🏭 Module 03 — Inheritance

* Basic inheritance
* Protected vs private access
* Constructors/destructors in inheritance
* Polymorphic behavior introduction

### 🔄 Module 04 — Polymorphism & Abstract Classes

* Virtual functions and method overriding
* Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
* Deep copy vs shallow copy
* Understanding virtual destructors

### 📦 Module 05 — Exceptions

* Exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `throw`
* Custom exception classes
* Best practices for exception-safe code

### 🧰 Module 06 — Casts and C++ Conversion Types

* `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`
* How and when to use each type safely
* Conversion operators
* Type identification with typeid and dynamic_cast in polymorphic classes

### ⚙️ Module 07 — Templates & More
* Templates and function templates
* Iterators and generic programming
* Advanced use of templates
* Template specialization
* Compiler errors with templates
* Templated class design

### 🧪 Module 08 — Templated Containers

* Creating your own templated container
* Iterators and algorithm compatibility
* Understanding compiler behavior with templates
* Designing reusable and type-safe components

### 🧬 Module 09 — C++ mini-projects

* File I/O
* Implementing a custom container (e.g., a vector or stack, map, list, ...)
* Designing iterators
* Type conversion and casting
* Compatibility with standard algorithms (if applicable)
* Practical mini-projects combining all previous knowledge

## Purpose

These modules are meant to solidify core C++ concepts and help develop a structured, object-oriented, and modern C++ coding style. They serve as a bridge between theoretical understanding and real-world application of the C++ programming language.
